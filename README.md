## Fluent Conf 2013 Hack projects

Inspired by a node.js talk, we decided to hack on a socket.io chat client. In addition, we're throwing in Angular.js and Grunt. Maybe add some Bower or Express.js, too.

This code was thrown together over a total of a handful hours. It is horrible, horrible code that should never be reused or shown to others.
